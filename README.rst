earthkit-transforms
===================

**DISCLAIMER**

   This project is in the **BETA** stage of development. Please be aware
   that interfaces and functionality may change as the project develops.
   If this software is to be used in operational systems you are
   **strongly advised to use a released tag in your system
   configuration**, and you should be willing to accept incoming changes
   and bug fixes that require adaptations on your part. ECMWF **does
   use** this software in operations and abides by the same caveats.

**earthkit-transforms** is a library of software tools to support people
working with climate and meteorology data

**earthkit-transforms** includes methods for aggregating data in time
and space, and more transforms and operators. It has been designed
following the philosphy of Earthkit, hence the methods should be
interoperable with any data object understood by earthkit-data.

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   pip install earthkit-transforms

Import and use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from earthkit.transforms import aggregate

    daily_mean = aggregate.temporal.daily_mean(MY_DATA)

Detailed documentation
----------------------

Please refer the `earthkit-transforms readthedocs
page <https://earthkit-transforms.readthedocs.io>`__ for more detailed
documentation, example notebooks and the API reference guide.

Workflow for developers/contributors
------------------------------------

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g.Â DEVELOP) with
Python 3.11:

::

   conda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.11
   conda activate DEVELOP

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: ``make conda-env-update``
2. Install this package: ``pip install -e .``
3. Run quality assurance checks: ``make default``
