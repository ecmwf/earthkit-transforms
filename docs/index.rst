Welcome to Earthkit-transformsâ€™s documentation!
===============================================

**earthkit-transforms** is a library of software tools to support people
working with climate and meteorology data. It is made of sub-modules desigined
for  transformations of data in specific domains.
For example, the temporal module contains methods for aggregation and
statistics analysis accross time dimensions/coordinates.
**earthkit-transforms** has been designed
following the philosophy of earthkit, hence the methods should be
interoperable with any data object understood by earthkit-data.
Under the bonnet, **earthkit-transforms** generally uses 
[xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) for computations,
therefore it recommended to prepare your data as xarray objects
before using the methods. This ensure clarity and consistency of the
output produced by **earthkit-transforms**.

Getting started
---------------

**earthkit-transforms** is available from PyPi. To make use of the
interoperable functionality you should ensure that you have installed
the dependencies of *earthkit-data*.
