Welcome to Earthkit-transformsâ€™s documentation!
===============================================

**earthkit-transforms** is a library of software tools to support people
working with climate and meteorology data

**earthkit-transforms** includes methods for aggregating data in time

following the philosphy of Earthkit, hence the methods should be
interoperable with any data object understood by earthkit-data.
